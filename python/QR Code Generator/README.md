# QR Code Generator

```qrcode.py``` is a python program which generates **QR Code** of the **link/url** provided by the user and **saves** the generated QR Code as a **PNG** and a **SVG** file which the user enters when the program is executed.

Also, since the user enters the name for files saved, unique names are given to each file saved which makes this program reusable for multiple times which increases the productivity of this user.

**Libraries Used:-**
- PyQRCode
- pypng

**Install Requirements:-**
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**Run the program:-**
```python qrcode.py```

After that, just simply enter the link/url & filename and then you'll get to see the QR Code in the same folder where you have your Python Program.
